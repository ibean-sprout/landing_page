Centered the content div and set to flex, created a
 secondary div to hold the paragraph elemets, added
seperate styling to paragraph elements. Added a flex
basis of 100% to the first paragrapha and justify-content
flex-end to the second. Doing so made the first paragraph
take up the entire row length of the container div
and only centered the second element to the end.
